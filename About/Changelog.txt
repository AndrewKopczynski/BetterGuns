- Spent some time on improving the spread sheet, so it calculates DPS for us.
-> Simplified a lot of explanations on the sheet
 
-> Hopefull this will help us with balancing, as we had to calculate it manually before.

!! Reverted Human health scaling from 2.5x to 1.0x. Gun damage is approx 1.2x higher than vanilla still. !!
- Scrapped all the old values, here's a new list of damage buffs:

- Pistol damage remains at 10 from vanilla
- Lee-Enfield damage up to 22 (from 18)
- M-16 damage up to 12 (from 7)
- M-24 damage up to 48 (from 40)
-> This means that unarmored targets are dead meat. Wear armor against snipers, it WILL save your life.

- Uzi damage up to 8 (from 5)
- L-15 LMG damage up to 10 (from 7)
- R4 Charge Rifle damage up to 16 (from 14)
-> R4 Charge Rifle now does pulse damage, causing pulse burns.
-> Pulse burns don't heal naturally, require full doctoring care. They don't bleed though due to cauterization,
so you're not in any damager of bleeding out on the battlefield.

- Improvised Turret Gun damage up to 10 (from 7)
- Minigun damage remains at 8 from vanilla
- Heavy Charge Blaster down to 16 (from 18)
-> HCB now does pulse damage, causing pulse burns like the R4 charge rifle

- Inferno Cannon damage remains at 50 from vanilla
- Charge Lance damage up to 30 (from 27)
- T-9 Incendiary Launcher damage up to 8 (from 4)
-> T-9 Launcher bolts are now explosive in a 1.2 blast radius. Great for flushing people out of cover!

- Frag Grenade damage up to 50 (from 40)
- Molotov Cocktail damage up to 15 (from 10, though they're still really inaccurate)
- EMP grenade damage remaines at 80 from vanilla

- Short Bow damage down to 7 from 10
- Great Bow damage down to 10 from 15
- Pila damage down to 20 from 30
- Handful of Stones damage down to 3 from 6

- 357 revolver damage is now 15
- 12 Gauge pellet damage is now 6 (fires 9 at once)
- Sjogren pellet damage is now 6 (fires 9 at once)
- Musket round shot damage is now 35
- Smart Rifle pulse round damage is now 28
-> Armored targets should never suffer permanent organ damage
-> Still does pulse damage/inflicts pulse burns

- Flamethrower damange remains at 1, but has regained the ability to fire five "flames" per shot
- Railgun Rifle damage is now 25
- USP Match damage is now 10
- MP7 damage is now 8

- Tweaked all of the guns base prices. Most of the vanilla guns only went slightly up in cost
 (~10 silver or so except for the M24, which has jumped up), while new modded weapons went slightly down in cost
- Railgun rifle price down from 700 to 210, should be balanced enough for regular play
- Railgun rifle now has a forced miss radius, should be interesting to see how it works now

- Added 5% pulse burn resistance to the M1 helmet and Kevlar helmet. They don't do much to stop energy/pulse rounds, really
- Added 10% pulse burn resistance to the vest plate/body armor (it's better than nothing)
- Bumped gunshot resistance to 60% on the powered armor set (it was 35% before, the same as a midworld vest plate)
- Added 50% pulse burn resistance to the powered armor set, as they're built for advanced warfare
- Fixed T-Shirt not covering the arms
- Fixed Buttoned Shirt not covering the arms
- Fixed Duster not covering the arms/legs. It's a long coat, after all
-> Tweaked the stats slightly down to compensate for this, so it's not just a straight upgrade

- Fixed Jacket not covering the arms
- Powered armor now covers the entire lower body
-> Temporary until pants and stuff are introduced

- Added DartToxic damage type
-> Inflicts the toxic injury
-> Very high chance of scarring

  ///////////
 // v0.05 //
///////////
!! Changed human health scaling from 1.0x to 2.5x. Gun damage is still 3.0x what it is in the vanilla, so this should hopefully make injuries more appropriate. I did plenty of testing on this, and it seemed to be in a good spot. This may conflict with other mods, and if it's too big of a burden then I'll just bump weapon damage down instead and leave health scaling as it is.

- Nerfed M24 from 120 damage to 100 damage. You're still dead without armor on a bad shot, but will survive major organ damage if you're wearing armor.
- Nerfed Smart Rifle from 99 damage to 70 damage. It's a police rifle, it doesn't blast arms and legs off.
- Changed Sjogren to use buckshot instead of birdshot.
- Nerfed 357 to 95% / 92% / 86% / 75% (from 100% / 96% / 86% / 78%)
- Raised Shotgun accuracy and range slightly.
- Raised the M24's touch accuracy from 50% to 60% to make the accuracy curve smoother

- Added stats for the Gauss Gun (high damange, high cooldown, medium range)
- Added stats for the Spas 12 (Faster than the 12 Gauge, shorter range, slightly less damage)
- Added stats for the USP Match (Lower damage than the base pistol, more accurate and faster overall)
- Added stats for the MP7 (Great close-quarters, awful at longer ranges)

- Added the Heavy Railgun Rifle. It's heavy, and it's a railgun. Should be pretty rare to find.
- Added the MP7, a close-quarters SMG
- Finished art for the Flare Gun, though I'm not completely happy with it. Probably will redo.
- Added the Smart Rifle, it uses pulse rounds. Can't target buildings.

- Added a new kind of damage and respective injury: Pulse and Pulse burn
-> Pulse burns have a high chance of scaring
-> Pulse rounds don't make targets bleed due to cauterizing wounds on contact

  ///////////
 // v0.04 //
///////////
- Removed guaranteed hits entirely from flamethrower, flames may only happen to intercept the target.
- Gave the flamethrower some actual, playable stats. It still feels a little strong, but I'll see how it plays out in actual games.
- Nerfed shirt damage reduction to 2% from 3%.
- Nerfed jacket/duster damage reduction to 3% from 8%, but removed the move speed penalty.
- Nerfed body armor from 40% to 35%. Wearing a shirt+duster+body armor gave you 51% damage reduction originally,
which was a little a little funny seeing how big a difference wearing a jacket was. It made power armor too useless though.

- Changed power armor damage reduction to 68%, from 70%. You're probably always going to wear at least a shirt, right?
- Scrapped birdshot on the Sjogren for now. It now uses the 12 Gauge's buckshot instead.
- Rebalanced Lee Enfield price to 203 silver.
- Rebalanced M16 price to 308 silver.
- Rebalanced M24 price to 267 silver.
- Rebalanced Uzi price to 224 silver.
- Rebalanced L-15 LMG price to 356 silver.
- Rebalanced R-4 Charge Rifle damage to 356 silver.
- Rebalanced Minigun price to 564 silver.
- The T-9 Launcher has been reworked into a gun that fires explosive fire payloads. Excellent for flushing people out of cover, but not very damaging. Rebalanced the price to 244 silver.
- Rebalanced 357 price to 296 silver from 60 silver.
- Rebalanced 12 Gauge price to 282 silver from 400 silver.
- Rebalanced Sjogren price to 300 silver from 400 silver.
- Added Musket price. It's not very high.
- Added Smart Rifle price, 604 silver.
- Rebalanced Makeshift Flamethrower price to 460 silver
- Attempted to clean up some code, made some nice descriptions for the guns.
- Added a Credits.txt for sound, code, balancing, etc.

  ///////////
 // v0.03 //
///////////
- Updated fire code to make shotguns feel less luck-reliant. 
-> They can no longer hit every single pellet in one godly shot (but have a guaranteed amount of pellet hits on a true "hit").

- Added Musket (credits to Bog for the texture)
- Added Smart Rifle

  ///////////
 // v0.02 //
///////////
- Added Makeshift Flamethrower sounds
- Added 357 Revolver fire sound
- Completely replaced vanilla "Pump Shotgun" with the 12 Gauge Shotgun.

  ///////////
