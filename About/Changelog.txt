v0.06
- Spent some time on improving the spread sheet, so it calculates DPS for us.
-> Hopefull this will help us with balancing, as we had to calculate it manually before.

v0.05
!! Changed human health scaling from 1.0x to 2.5x. Gun damage is still 3.0x what it is in the vanilla, so this should hopefully make injuries more appropriate. I did plenty of testing on this, and it seemed to be in a good spot. This may conflict with other mods, and if it's too big of a burden then I'll just bump weapon damage down instead and leave health scaling as it is.

- Nerfed M24 from 120 damage to 100 damage. You're still dead without armor on a bad shot, but will survive major organ damage if you're wearing armor.
- Nerfed Smart Rifle from 99 damage to 70 damage. It's a police rifle, it doesn't blast arms and legs off.
- Changed Sjogren to use buckshot instead of birdshot.
- Nerfed 357 to 95% / 92% / 86% / 75% (from 100% / 96% / 86% / 78%)
- Raised Shotgun accuracy and range slightly.
- Raised the M24's touch accuracy from 50% to 60% to make the accuracy curve smoother

- Added stats for the Gauss Gun (high damange, high cooldown, medium range)
- Added stats for the Spas 12 (Faster than the 12 Gauge, shorter range, slightly less damage)
- Added stats for the USP Match (Lower damage than the base pistol, more accurate and faster overall)
- Added stats for the MP7 (Great close-quarters, awful at longer ranges)

- Added the Heavy Railgun Rifle. It's heavy, and it's a railgun. Should be pretty rare to find.
- Added the MP7, a close-quarters SMG
- Finished art for the Flare Gun, though I'm not completely happy with it. Probably will redo.
- Added the Smart Rifle, it uses pulse rounds. Can't target buildings.

- Added a new kind of damage and respective injury: Pulse and Pulse burn
-> Pulse burns have a high chance of scaring
-> Pulse rounds don't make targets bleed due to cauterizing wounds on contact


v0.04
- Removed guaranteed hits entirely from flamethrower, flames may only happen to intercept the target.
- Gave the flamethrower some actual, playable stats. It still feels a little strong, but I'll see how it plays out in actual games.
- Nerfed shirt damage reduction to 2% from 3%.
- Nerfed jacket/duster damage reduction to 3% from 8%, but removed the move speed penalty.
- Nerfed body armor from 40% to 35%. Wearing a shirt+duster+body armor gave you 51% damage reduction originally,
which was a little a little funny seeing how big a difference wearing a jacket was. It made power armor too useless though.

- Changed power armor damage reduction to 68%, from 70%. You're probably always going to wear at least a shirt, right?
- Scrapped birdshot on the Sjogren for now. It now uses the 12 Gauge's buckshot instead.
- Rebalanced Lee Enfield price to 203 silver.
- Rebalanced M16 price to 308 silver.
- Rebalanced M24 price to 267 silver.
- Rebalanced Uzi price to 224 silver.
- Rebalanced L-15 LMG price to 356 silver.
- Rebalanced R-4 Charge Rifle damage to 356 silver.
- Rebalanced Minigun price to 564 silver.
- The T-9 Launcher has been reworked into a gun that fires explosive fire payloads. Excellent for flushing people out of cover, but not very damaging. Rebalanced the price to 244 silver.
- Rebalanced 357 price to 296 silver from 60 silver.
- Rebalanced 12 Gauge price to 282 silver from 400 silver.
- Rebalanced Sjogren price to 300 silver from 400 silver.
- Added Musket price. It's not very high.
- Added Smart Rifle price, 604 silver.
- Rebalanced Makeshift Flamethrower price to 460 silver
- Attempted to clean up some code, made some nice descriptions for the guns.
- Added a Credits.txt for sound, code, balancing, etc.

v0.03
- Updated fire code to make shotguns feel less luck-reliant. 
-> They can no longer hit every single pellet in one godly shot (but have a guaranteed amount of pellet hits on a true "hit").

- Added Musket (credits to Bog for the texture)
- Added Smart Rifle

v0.02
- Added Makeshift Flamethrower sounds
- Added 357 Revolver fire sound
- Completely replaced vanilla "Pump Shotgun" with the 12 Gauge Shotgun.

v0.01
- Initial version!
- Added 12 Gauge Shotgun, it's got spread like an actual shotgun!
- Added Sjogren Shotgun, an old semi-auto shotty.
- Added 357 Revolver, a high-power, high recoil handgun.
- Added Makeshift Flamethrower, a brutal and destructive that burns all in its way.
